## About

A sense of humour and mental agility is a requirement when teaching yoga to children. It must instantly and constantly engage them. From trips to the Zoo, where each child becomes an animal, with accompanying animal sounds!! To a simple walk around their mats singing, jumping and stretching. Yoga actively combines the body with the mind, using breath, active movements and balance as tools for achieving this objective.

Yoga for those with different abilities, or special needs, offers a range of techniques for calming or focusing the body. This is achieved through breathing, movement and mindfulness. Children can experience a sense of being in the present moment, may move towards a reduced sense of anxiety and over time perhaps develop a level of resilience.

### Benefits of Yoga for Children
A Mindful meditation can help children by;
1.	Giving them the habit of focusing on the present moment & ignoring distractions.
2.	Teaching them to stay calm in the face of lifeâ€™s stressful times.
3.	Creates good habits for their future. If faced with any challenges, they know they can find peace by taking a few moments to meditate.
4.	Promotes happiness by lowering social anxiety & stress.
5.	Promotes patience.
6.	Improves executive functions such as cognitive control, working memory, & cognitive flexibility.
7.	Improves attentiveness & impulse control.
