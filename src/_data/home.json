  "body": "As a Scientist, I have observed how yoga builds physical strength, increases flexibility, and soothes the mind. I practice and teach predominantly Hatha and Vinyasa yoga, blending alignment with breath awareness and dynamic movement.",
  "content": "The human body is finely balanced, it is important to stretch our bodies regularly at every age, or our range of movement may reduce. Yoga offers everyone, of every age, and every ability, a roadmap for increased suppleness. My teaching style is informal, often we are more amenable to new experiences and concepts when feeling relaxed. I teach the alignment aspects of each pose in class, so you can practice effectively at home, at your own pace, regardless of whether that is on a mat, or in a chair. A mindful meditative experience is a primary constituent of yoga, by giving the body permission to relax, the mind in turn relaxes and we begin to feel less stressed in our daily lives."
